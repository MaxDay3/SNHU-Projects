*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-This a project created in python to analyze purchase frequency at The Corner Grocer to help give data driven results.

*What did you do particularly well?
-Designed an intuitive user interface. 

*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-I would Improve efficiency with 'collections.Counter' and add a test case error handling for better robustness. 

*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-I would say designing the user interface was the most challenging; dividing the tasks into small functions (loose coupling) helped

*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-I would say user interface desing and file handling. 

*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-Went with modular design, documentaion, and error handling for maintenance and adaptability.
